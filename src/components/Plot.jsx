              Unlike many other films, M*A*S*H lacks a traditional defined plot and instead follows the antics of a team of medical specialists during the Korean War.

              In 1951, the 4077th Mobile Army Surgical Hospital in South Korea is assigned two new surgeons, "Hawkeye" Pierce and "Duke" Forrest, who arrive in a stolen Army Jeep. The two surgeons are characterized by their insubordinate, womanizing, and mischievous attitudes, however, they prove to be excellent combat surgeons. Other characters stationed at the camp include the foolish commanding officer Henry Blake, his hyper-competent chief clerk Radar O'Reilly, dentist Walter "Painless Pole" Waldowski, the incompetent and pretentious surgeon Frank Burns, and the Chaplain Father Mulcahy.

              The primary characters at the camp are divided into two factions. Irritated by Frank's religious affairs, Hawkeye and Duke persuade Blake to relocate him to another tent so that the newly arrived surgeon Trapper John McIntyre can move in. The three doctors have little regard for military protocol, having been drafted into the Army, and are prone to pranks and heavy drinking. Frank is a strict military officer who expects everything to be done efficiently and correctly, as is Margaret Houlihan, the 4077th's head nurse. The two bond over their respect for regulations and start a secret romance. With Radar's help, the three doctors, nicknamed the "Swampmen", smuggle a microphone into a tent where the couple is having sex and broadcast their sexual comments over the camp's PA system, humiliating them and earning Houlihan the nickname "Hot Lips". The next morning, Hawkeye provokes Frank into assaulting him, prompting his removal from the camp for psychiatric evaluation. Later, as Hot Lips is showering, the Swampmen prank her by removing the tent sides and exposing her naked body in order to settle a bet on whether she is a natural blonde.

              Painless, dubbed "the best-equipped dentist in the Army", becomes depressed after an episode of impotence and announces his intention to commit suicide, fearing that he has turned homosexual. The Swampmen agree to assist him in carrying out his suicide, staging a feast, mimicing Leonardo da Vinci's painting "The Last Supper", arranging for Father Mulcahy to administer Painless absolution and last communion, as well as providing him with sleeping drugs to speed up the suicide. Hawkeye persuedes Lieutenant "Dish" Schneider, who has remained faithful to her husband and is being moved back to the United States for discharge, to spend the night with Painless in order to ease his concerns about his "latent homosexuality". The next morning, Painless is back to his usual cheerful self, and Dish leaves camp in a helicopter on the way back to the United States.

              Trapper and Hawkeye are sent to Japan for a short assignment to operate on a Congressman's son. When they later perform an unauthorized operation on a local infant, they are disciplined by the hospital commander for misuse of Army resources. Trapper sedates the commander with anesthetic gas and later use fabricated photographs of him waking up in bed with a prostitute to blackmail him into silence.

            <p className="mt-6 text-lg leading-8 text-gray-600">
              Following the pair's return to camp Blake and General Hammond plan a football game between the 4077th and 325th Evac Hospitals, betting several thousand dollars on the outcome. Blake, at Hawkeye's recommendation, requests that a specific neurosurgeon, Dr. Oliver Harmon "Spearchucker" Jones, a former professional football player for the San Francisco 49ers be moved to the 4077th as a ringer. Hawkeye also proposes that Blake bets half of his money up front to keep Jones out of the first half of the game. The 325th scores frequently and with ease, even after the 4077th drugged one of their star players. Blake bets the remaining money against Hammond's confident assurance of high odds.

              Shortly after the football game, Hawkeye and Duke get their discharge orders and begin their journey home, taking the same stolen Jeep in which they had arrived.
