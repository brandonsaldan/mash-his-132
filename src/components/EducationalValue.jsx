              The film boldly embraces anti-authoritarian and anti-war themes throughout its narrative, challenging conventional notions of military discipline and the glorification of war. The film critiques the rigid hierarchy and stifling bureaucracy of the military establishment through the irreverent antics of characters like Hawkeye and Trapper, who openly defy authority and subvert traditional norms. M*A*S*H also explores the senselessness and brutality of war, depicting the absurdity of conflict through its portrayal of the Korean War setting. By highlighting the human toll of war and the dehumanizing effects of violence, the film confronts viewers with the realities of armed conflict that remain true to this day.
